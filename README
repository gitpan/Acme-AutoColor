NAME
    Acme::AutoColor - automatic color names

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::AutoColor;

      $red   = RED();    # 'ff0000'
      @green = GREEN();  # (0, 255, 0)

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses an AUTOLOAD function which assumes unrecognized methods
    are color names.

    Color names are case-insensitive, though style-wise one should probably
    use all capitals.

    It returns a hex string or a an array of RGB triplets depending on the
    calling context.

    Color schemes may be specified in the use line:

      use Acme::AutoColor qw( X HTML );

OCTARINE

Octarine is the discworlds eigth color. It can't actually displayed with a RGB color scheme,
but as far as we know, its R, G and B components are all zero. But you can use it anyway:

  $octarine   = OCTARINE();    # '000000'

Beware: Using OCTARINE() may - depending on your location, status as wizard and general thaumic
background radiation levels - reconfigure your computer to display itself. This may result in
damage to your system, secondary thaumic events, creatures from the dungeon dimensions appearing
or the universe collapsing on itself.
