NAME
    Acme::AutoColor - automatic color names

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses an AUTOLOAD function which assumes unrecognized methods
    are color names.

    Color names are case-insensitive, though style-wise one should probably
    use all capitals.

    It returns a hex string or a an array of RGB triplets depending on the
    calling context.

    Color schemes may be specified in the use line:

      use Acme::AutoColor qw( X HTML );
